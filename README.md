# Android-Based-Automatic-Railway-Level-Gate-Control
IN this project Iam using arduino and bluetooth with IR sensors. This can help railways to prevent accidents caused in level gates due to human error. This project includes three parts: 1.Android Controlled Railway Level Gate 2.Automatic Railway Level Gate 3. Obstacle Collision Prevention System for Locomotive which will sense obstacle and applies automatic brakes if obstacle is detected for described time.
